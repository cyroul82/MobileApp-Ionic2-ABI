This is an application using Ionic Framework v3.13.0.

*Useless application but helpful to understand Cordova, its plugins and the framework Ionic.*<br>
*The app has a side menu with 4 menus*<br>
<ul>
  <li>Home Page</li>
  <li>Collaborateurs</li>
  <li>Remote Collaborateurs</li>
  <li>Fingerprints</li>
</ul>

The app is fetching a list of "contacts (Collaborateurs)" from a RestFul WebService and displays them in a page "Remote Collaborateurs".<br>
From this list we can import the collaborateur into the app collaborateur list (using the storage plugin to save them) or into the contact phone.
The detail page of a collaborateur allows us to find out the location (using google maps) as well as the weather (using the API [Darksky.net](https://darksky.net/) for this collaborateur's address.
