  <h3>Projet using IONIC Framework </h3>
  <p>This is an application using Ionic Framework v3.13.0.<br>
  Useless application but helpful to understand Cordova, its plugins
  and the framework Ionic.</p>

  This project aims to learn how to use cordova plugins and to discover Ionic Framework, the errors are not handled.<br>
   In order to use the app, make sure to create a file : apiKey.ts in src/app and export the google maps API key as well ass
  the darksky.net API Key : see the example below -> <br>
  <p>
  export var mapApiKey = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';<br>
  export var weatherApiKey = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';<br>
  </p>
  
  <p>The app is fetching a list of "contacts (Collaborateurs)" from a RestFul WebService and displays them in a page "Remote Collaborateurs".
  <br> From this list we can import the collaborateur into the app collaborateur list (using the storage plugin to save them) or
  into the contact phone.
  <br> The detail page of a collaborateur allows us to find out the location (using google maps) as well as the weather (using
  the API [Darksky.net](https://darksky.net/) for this collaborateur's address.
